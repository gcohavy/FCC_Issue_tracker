Project Issue Tracker

Using node and express
Connected to MongoDB database and issued GET, POST, PUT and DELETE commands to track user inputs
Built functional tests using Chai

note** final delete test runs twice, the first time not receiving a proper _id since the database is clear. I left it that way.
